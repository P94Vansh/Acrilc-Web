            "Sambit doesn't just start companies, he starts conversations that scale.",
            "Born in West Bengal with a deep-rooted love for culture, he's seen what happens when traditional art is sidelined by modern noise. Acrilc began as his quiet rebellion — now, it's a full-blown ecosystem for artists.",
            "He leads with vision, curiosity, and the kind of late-night whiteboard energy that makes the team both nervous and inspired.",
            "For Sambit, art and technology aren't opposites, they're overdue collaborators. And at Acrilc, he's making sure that partnership finally happens.",
            "You'll rarely find him standing still unless it's in front of a painting that deserves it."

        description: [
            "Calm in chaos. Deadlines fear him. Spreadsheets respect him.",
            "Joydip is a Physiotherapist by profession and an artist by passion — a combination that makes him surprisingly good at managing both people and pixels. He and Sambit once spent weeks exploring the lanes of Bengal, speaking with artists, listening more than talking, and seeing up close how much talent goes unnoticed.",
            "That trip didn't just inspire conversations — it shaped how Acrilc works today: direct, intentional, and built for real creators.",
            "At Acrilc, Joydip keeps the engine running without needing to be loud about it.",
            "He's the one making sure the lights stay on — and the team doesn't burn out."

        description: [
            "Mohit is the kind of person who makes tech feel less like a machine, and more like it's working with you. He quietly builds the backbone of Acrilc — fast, secure, and ready to grow with every artist who joins.",
            "He's up before sunrise, fixes things before they break, and somehow brings football scores and Breaking Bad into every conversation.",
            "If everything on Acrilc feels smooth and simple, that's Mohit — doing what he does best, behind the scenes."

            "Sanpreet is the bridge between what we say and how people feel it. Whether it's a press release, an Instagram caption, or the voice of the brand itself — she makes sure Acrilc doesn't just talk, it speaks to you.",
            "She's a Hyderabadi with Punjabi soul — grounded in faith, fuelled by creativity, and always ready for a last-minute trip or a deep conversation over chai.",
            "Sharp with words, soft with people — Sanpreet doesn't just craft communication. She builds connection."

            "Avantika doesn't just review art — she lives it. An artist herself, she brings a deep understanding of the creative process into every decision she makes at Acrilc.",
            "Her strength lies in spotting the things others overlook. Whether it's a missed detail or a feeling that's just off — she'll call it out, fix it, and move on, sometimes all in one breath.",
            "Creative, sharp, and occasionally impatient when it matters — Avantika makes sure that what leaves Acrilc reflects the kind of art she believes in: honest, intentional, and worth noticing."
